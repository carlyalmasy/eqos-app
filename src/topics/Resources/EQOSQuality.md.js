## The EQOS Quality Signal

Our initiative's objective is to offer a comprehensive overview of the current credential landscape and equip a variety of stakeholders with the necessary insights to make informed decisions regarding credential acquisition. Through an extensive evaluation process of credential programs and providers, utilizing LinkedIn profiles and additional datasets, we are developing user-friendly tools accessible to the public.

The EQOS Quality Signal represents an outcome-driven assessment of credential quality, leveraging a substantial dataset of self-reported credentials and career histories. Unlike traditional methods reliant on provider-collected data, our approach offers a more robust and objective evaluation.

Our quality framework revolves around five key dimensions: employment, access, opportunity, learning, and demand. These dimensions encompass various outcome-based metrics sourced from both public and proprietary datasets. Our alpha release dataset comprises over 3.5 million observed credentials from more than 2.6 million individuals and 5,000+ providers.
