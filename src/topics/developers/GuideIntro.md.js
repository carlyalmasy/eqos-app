# EQOS Developers Guide

The purpose of this guide is to get developers started with the basic concepts of accessing and using the API by providing practical coding examples.

> **NOTE:** All code examples are written in vanilla JavaScript making use of the [axios library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for making HTTP requests.

Below, we'll cover several basic ways to interact with the API as well as specific use cases identified for our early adoption scenarios.  For comprehensive information about the various API endpoints, including example response structures and available parameters, developers are encouraged to review our [API Documentation](/developers/api).
