## Quality is Our Mission

The Education Quality Outcomes Standards (EQOS) organization mission is to establish independent measure of quality to help people navigate the increasingly crowded and confusing education and training marketplace.  EQOS' vision is to deliver ongoing evaluations of a comprehensive set of non-degree credentials that are user-friendly, that empower real-world decisions, and that accurately describe the lived experience of us leaners.
